			<p><b>Eh, what is this?</b><br>
			We are the Incredible Super Build (ISB haha... sorry) Team, affiliated with the Maker's Club, currently building a 20 meter long roller coaster to be finished and ridable by the Innovation EXPO on November 25th.
			</p>
			<p><b>How can I get involved?</b><br>
			In order to get this project finished on time, we need your help! We are usually building on Wednesdays (2:30-6:00 PM) and Fridays (3:30-6:00 PM), as well as flexible time on weekends. See building schedule in the table below. We meet and build in the Library Courtyard. If we have sparked your curiosity or you would like to volunteer, please scan the QR code to join our WeChat group where you can ask more questions and get updates on the project!
			</p>
			<p>Before you come to help out, you will need to have your parents signed a waiver regarding working with power tools and other machinary. <a href="files/ParentalConsentWaiverForm_TheIncredibleSuperBuildProject.pdf">Click here to download the waiver</a>, print it and bring it to us signed to start building!
